# Diabetes Prediction using Supervised Learning

## Project Introduction

This repository documents the process and findings of a supervised machine learning project aimed at predicting the occurrence of diabetes. The analysis is based on a dataset provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

## Dataset

The analysis utilizes the "Diabetes" dataset, which contains diagnostic measurements that are used to predict the diabetes status of patients.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase involves a thorough examination of the dataset to understand the underlying structure and to identify any anomalies or patterns. The following tasks were completed:

- Checked for missing values.
- Explored the relationships between predictor variables and the outcome variable.
- Assessed the correlation between predictor variables.
- Investigated the distribution of predictor variables.
- Detected and evaluated outliers.
- Analyzed the interaction effects between predictor variables.
- Calculated average age, glucose level, and BMI for individuals with and without diabetes.
- Conducted gender-based comparisons of predictor variables, when applicable.

## Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing step included:

- Handling missing values and zero entries that may represent missing data.
- Correcting outliers or making the decision to keep them based on their potential impact on the model.
- Implementing feature scaling and normalization to ensure model accuracy and efficiency.
- Performing feature engineering to improve model performance.
- Addressing data imbalance to ensure model fairness and improve predictive performance.

## Model Training and Evaluation

Two models were trained and evaluated:

1. **Random Forest Classifier**: An ensemble method benefiting from the robustness of decision trees.
2. **XGBoost Classifier**: A powerful boosting algorithm known for its speed and performance.

The models were evaluated using a range of metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The project concludes with a detailed comparison of the Random Forest and XGBoost models, discussing the handling of class imbalance, parameter tuning, and the implications of model performance. Recommendations are provided based on the analysis, with a focus on healthcare applications where recall may be prioritized.
