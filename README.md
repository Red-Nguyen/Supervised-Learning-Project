# Supervised Learning Project: Diabetes Prediction
### Overview
This repository hosts a supervised learning project with the objective of predicting diabetes occurrences. Utilizing the "Diabetes" dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, the project applies machine learning techniques to diagnose the presence of diabetes in patients.

### Objective
The aim is to construct a machine learning model employing supervised learning methods to accurately predict diabetes.

### Project Description
The project encompasses exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and the training of predictive models. Insights and model performances are elucidated using data visualization tools.

### Tasks
Data Analysis & Pre-processing: Importation and cleaning of the dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and conducting feature engineering.
Model Training & Evaluation: Development and assessment of machine learning models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
